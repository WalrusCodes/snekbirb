// * Levels are ASCII files.
//
// * Comments start with // and are ignored.
//
// * The grid is described by a rectangular block of
//   ASCII characters, one character per tile.
//
// * Supported tiles are as follows:
//         . : empty spaces
//         E : exit
//         F : any fruit
//         @ : teleporter
//         # : ground
//         * : spiky boi
//    0-9a-z : snek segment (in base36, see below)
//       U-Z : block segment
//
// * Sneks are described by continuous numbers in base 36 (0-9, followed by
//   lowercase a-z). The smallest number in this range is the snek head. To
//   specify multiple sneks, create a gap in the numbering, e.g.: 012 45.
//
// * Blocks (including disjoint movable thingamabobs) are described by letters
//   in U-Z range. Same letter means it is part of same block. E.g, U...U describes
//   a handle thing that can be passed through, but still the two Us are
//   magically connected in the background.
